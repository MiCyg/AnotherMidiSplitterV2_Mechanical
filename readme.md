The enclosure was designed in Autodesk Inventor. It consists of two parts. For now, the plan is to fasten them together with screws, but this concept may change later. If you don’t have Inventor, you can download the STL files directly from [GrabCad](https://grabcad.com/library/anothermidisplitterv2_case-1).
